# Obtaining DataFrames

The `pandas` package provides a super-charged datatype called the `DataFrame`, which represents tabular, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns.

We can obtain a `DataFrame` object by either reading a CSV file, or by constructing one ourselves.


## Reading CSV Files

If we have data files in tabular format (for example in CSV format, or XLS / XLSX format), we can use the [`read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function, or [`read_excel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html) function, respectively, to convert that data into a `DataFrame` object. Here we will focus primarily on CSV files.

We can use these functions to read files saved locally, as well as hosted on the Internet.

### Local Files

In terms of reading local files, the file needs to be in the same location as the Python code.

For example, in the [Colab Filesystem](https://prof-rossetti.github.io/intro-software-dev-python-book/notes/dev-tools/google-colab/filesystem.html), there is a CSV file called "california_housing_train.csv" in the "sample_data" directory:

![Example CSV file in the Colab Filesystem](../../images/colab-sample-data-file.png){height=350}

```{python}
#| echo: False

import os
os.chdir("../../data/colab")
```

To read this file, we pass the relative filepath as a parameter to the `read_csv` function:


```{python}
from pandas import read_csv

csv_filepath = "sample_data/california_housing_train.csv"

df = read_csv(csv_filepath)
print(type(df))
df.head()
```


### Hosted Files

In terms of CSV formatted data hosted on the Internet, we note the URL of the hosted file, and pass it to the `read_csv` function:

```{python}
from pandas import read_csv

request_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/main/data/daily_adjusted_nflx.csv"

df = read_csv(request_url)
print(type(df))
df.head()
```



## Constructing DataFrames

We can also construct our own `DataFrame` objects.

If we have Python data in an eligible format (list of lists, list of dictionaries, dictionary of lists), we can pass that data to the [`DataFrame` class constructor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) to obtain a `DataFrame` object back.

### List of Lists

Here, we are constructing a `DataFrame` from a list of lists:

```{python}
from pandas import DataFrame

# list of lists:
prices = [
    ["2020-10-01", 100.00],
    ["2020-10-02", 101.01],
    ["2020-10-03", 120.20],
    ["2020-10-04", 107.07],
    ["2020-10-05", 142.42],
    ["2020-10-06", 135.35],
    ["2020-10-07", 160.60],
    ["2020-10-08", 162.62],
]

df = DataFrame(prices, columns=["date", "stock_price_usd"])
print(type(df))
df.head()
```

In this case we wind up with a row for each item in the outer list, and a column for each value in the inner list.

Because the lists don't have column names, we supply those separately, using the `columns` parameter.

### List of Dictionaries

Here, we are constructing a `DataFrame` from a list of dictionaries (i.e. "records" format), which is a very common and usable format:


```{python}
from pandas import DataFrame

# "records" format (list of dicts):
prices = [
    {"date": "2020-10-01", "stock_price_usd": 100.00},
    {"date": "2020-10-02", "stock_price_usd": 101.01},
    {"date": "2020-10-03", "stock_price_usd": 120.20},
    {"date": "2020-10-04", "stock_price_usd": 107.07},
    {"date": "2020-10-05", "stock_price_usd": 142.42},
    {"date": "2020-10-06", "stock_price_usd": 135.35},
    {"date": "2020-10-07", "stock_price_usd": 160.60},
    {"date": "2020-10-08", "stock_price_usd": 162.62},
]

df = DataFrame(prices)
print(type(df))
df.head()
```

In this case we wind up with a row for each dictionary in the list, and the dictionary keys become the column names.

### Dictionary of Lists

In this final example, we are constructing a `DataFrame` from a dictionary of lists:


```{python}
from pandas import DataFrame

# dict of lists:
prices = {
    "date": ["2020-10-01", "2020-10-02", "2020-10-03", "2020-10-04","2020-10-05", "2020-10-06", "2020-10-07", "2020-10-08"],
    "stock_price_usd": [100.00, 101.01, 120.20, 107.07, 142.42, 135.35, 160.60, 162.62]
}

df = DataFrame(prices)
print(type(df))
df.head()
```


In this case, the dictionary's keys become column names that describe the corresponding list of values in that column.
