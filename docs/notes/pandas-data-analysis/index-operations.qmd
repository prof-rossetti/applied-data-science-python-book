# Row Index Values


## Accessing the Index

Every `DataFrame` object has an index, which is a set of unique row identifiers.

The default index is a set of auto-incrementing numbers starting at 0.

```{python}
df.index
```

It is possible to convert the `Index` object to a list for simplicity:

```{python}
df.index.tolist()
```

## Resetting the Index


Every `DataFrame` has a default index values, but we can set our own.

We might do this in practice when one of the columns in the dataset contains values which uniquely identify each row in the dataset.

```
prices_df.index = prices_df["timestamp"]
```

## Resetting a Multi-Index

If our dataset has a multi-index (like a composite primary key comprised of multiple columns), we can convert the index components to their own columns, and reset the index to be simpler:

```
```
